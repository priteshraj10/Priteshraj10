Hi, I'm Pritesh Raj, a passionate self-taught Data Scientist and AI developer from India. My passion for AI lies in dreaming up ideas that can serve humanity in the best way and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community, and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happen through open-source.
